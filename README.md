# ZEF
FEZ Collectible Randomizer! (WIP)

## Installation
0. Make sure you have [HAT Mod Loader](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT) installed in your FEZ instance.
1. Download and unzip the release folder.
2. Put the unzipped folder in your `Mods` folder.
3. Run FEZ and start a new game!

## Current State
As of now, all this does is randomize the simple free-floating collectibles in the world. 
This includes all cube bits, full cubes not in chests, anti cubes not spawned or in chests, and a single key - essentially anything represented as a trile.
If you want a more feature-complete experience, I would suggest waiting a little longer till there's more to chew on. If you find any bugs, please let me know!

Also, as of now, this only works reliably on one save file. I can only guarantee success by using the same file for a whole playthrough, but you have free will so do as you must.

Things to look forward to:
- CHESTS!
- SPAWNED CUBES!!
- MORE FUN STUFF!!!

## Building
1. Use necessary dependencies.
2. Build it.
