# ZEF
FEZ Collectible Randomizer! (WIP)

Minimal Functionality, but technically working. Use with [admoore0's entrance randomizer](https://github.com/admoore0/fez-randomizer) for a particularly spicy playthrough.

## Installation
0. Make sure you have [HAT Mod Loader](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT) installed in your FEZ instance.
1. Download and unzip the [release](https://github.com/BDrewChris/ZEF/releases) folder.
2. Put the unzipped folder in your `Mods` folder.
3. Run FEZ and start a new game!

## Current State
Most collectibles have been included in the randomizer, though some of those collectibles are currently limited to their respective categories, e.g., maps, artifacts, and PoHs.
Right now, the game plays pretty similar to a vanilla playthrough, but I intend to add other features that should mix things up. Stay tuned (:

If you find any bugs in the current version, please let me know!

Also, as of now, this only works reliably on one save file. I can only guarantee success by using the same file for a whole playthrough, but you have free will so do as you must.

I also can't guarantee that everything will be 100% completable as there is no logic to the randomization currently, so enjoy and regard with a healthy dose of skepticism.

## Building
1. Use necessary dependencies.
2. Build it.
